# gdx-sqlite

*Note: This project is no more actively maintained. Please check out the various forks [here](https://github.com/mrafayaleem/gdx-sqlite/network) to follow up with active developments around this repository.*

gdx-sqlite is a cross-platform Libgdx extension for SQLite database handling. The extension handles database transactions across multiple platforms by a unified method. The extension adds SQLite support for desktop version of Libgdx application.

Currently supported platforms:
- Android (Implemented using Android SQLite API)
- Desktop (SQLite JDBC from https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/wiki/Home)

A small portion of code has been adapted from the tutorial located at:  http://www.vogella.com/articles/AndroidSQLite/article.html 

Latest build of this extension can be downloaded from: http://bit.ly/gdx-sqlite

## Extension setup in a Libgdx application:

Note: This setup assumes that you have properly setup your project as follows (or similar to the following):
 - App
 - AppDesktop
 - AppAndroid

#### For App project:
 - Copy gdx-sqlite.jar into your App project libs folder
 - In the Libraries tab of your Java Build Path, add the gdx-sqlite.jar

#### For AppDesktop project:
 - Copy gdx-sqlite-desktop.jar and sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2.jar into your AppDesktop project libs folder
 - In the Libraries tab of your Java Build Path, add the gdx-sqlite-desktop.jar and sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2.jar

#### For AppAndroid project:
 - Copy gdx-sqlite-android.jar into your AppAndroid project libs folder
 - In the Libraries tab of your Java Build Path, add the gdx-sqlite-android.jar and gdx-sqlite.jar
 - In the Order and Export tab of your Java Build Path, make sure that gdx-sqlite-android.jar and gdx-sqlite.jar are checked

#### For AppRoboVM project:
- Add following lines to robovm.xml
```
<forceLinkClasses>
	<pattern>com.badlogic.gdx.sqlite.robovm.RobovmDatabaseManager</pattern>
	<pattern>SQLite.**</pattern>
```

## Example Code:
```java
package com.mrafayaleem.gdxsqlitetest;

import com.badlogic.gdx.Gdx;
import com.badlogic.gdx.sql.Database;
import com.badlogic.gdx.sql.DatabaseCursor;
import com.badlogic.gdx.sql.DatabaseFactory;
import com.badlogic.gdx.sql.SQLiteGdxException;

public class DatabaseTest {

	Database dbHandler;

	public static final String TABLE_COMMENTS = "comments";
	public static final String COLUMN_ID = "_id";
	public static final String COLUMN_COMMENT = "comment";

	private static final String DATABASE_NAME = "comments.db";
	private static final int DATABASE_VERSION = 1;

	// Database creation sql statement
	private static final String DATABASE_CREATE = "create table if not exists "
			+ TABLE_COMMENTS + "(" + COLUMN_ID
			+ " integer primary key autoincrement, " + COLUMN_COMMENT
			+ " text not null);";

	public DatabaseTest() {
		Gdx.app.log("DatabaseTest", "creation started");
		dbHandler = DatabaseFactory.getNewDatabase(DATABASE_NAME,
				DATABASE_VERSION, DATABASE_CREATE, null);

		dbHandler.setupDatabase();
		try {
			dbHandler.openOrCreateDatabase();
			dbHandler.execSQL(DATABASE_CREATE);
		} catch (SQLiteGdxException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}

		Gdx.app.log("DatabaseTest", "created successfully");

		try {
			dbHandler
					.execSQL("INSERT INTO comments ('comment') VALUES ('This is a test comment')");
		} catch (SQLiteGdxException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}

		DatabaseCursor cursor = null;

		try {
			cursor = dbHandler.rawQuery("SELECT * FROM comments");
		} catch (SQLiteGdxException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		while (cursor.next()) {
			Gdx.app.log("FromDb", String.valueOf(cursor.getString(1)));
		}

		try {
			dbHandler.closeDatabase();
		} catch (SQLiteGdxException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		dbHandler = null;
		Gdx.app.log("DatabaseTest", "dispose");
	}
}
```

## Compiling the Code:
The repository contains all the necessary libraries and files to generate jar files. Three test projects are also added which depend on the respective gdx-sqlite projects to run. To generate jar files from the source code, clone the repository and execute ```ant clean build``` command from the root directory. This will generate jars in their respective folders (in jar directory of each gdx-sqlite project). Note that the gdx-sqlite projects are independent of the test projects.
